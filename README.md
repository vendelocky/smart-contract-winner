# ALCHEMY UNIVERSITY ASSIGNMENT - WEEK 4
Disclaimer: A portion of the codes are not written by me, as it is already provided from Alchemy University. But the assignment is to be completed in our version, and here is my version on this week assignment :)

## Smart Contract Winner

This project demonstrates the basic deployment of smart contract and to understand more about msg.sender and tx.origin.

This project also demonstrates how a Contract calls another Contract without relying on EOA directly.

### setup

Install dependencies in the top-level directory with `npm install`.

After you have installed hardhat locally, you can use commands to test and compile the contracts, among other things. To learn more about these commands run `npx hardhat help`.

Compile the contracts using `npx hardhat compile`. The artifacts will be placed in the `/app` folder, which will make it available to the front-end. This path configuration can be found in the `hardhat.config.js` file.
